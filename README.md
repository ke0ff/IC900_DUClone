# IC900_DUClone
Display clone to replace the LCD ICs/Glass of the original ICOM IC-900 controller

Current state of SW: initial symbol map created.  Working on mechanizing the internal structure of the uPD7225 in SW.

Current state of HW: Concept only.  Need to work out 3D print strategies to support illuminated nomenclature, then translate that into a physical button layout and finally a PCB that incorporates the LCD bridge, switches, and illumination & status LEDs
